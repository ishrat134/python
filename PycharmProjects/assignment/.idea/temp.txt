1. Migration from Legacy Schedulers to Dagster Orchestration
Identified and refactored legacy ETL scripts running on local machines via ad-hoc schedulers, which were prone to failures and lacked visibility.

Re-engineered and containerized these workflows into Dagster jobs, enabling hourly/daily automated execution with built-in monitoring, logging, and dependency management.

Reduced manual intervention by 90%, ensuring timely data availability for trading and analytics.

2. Elimination of Data Redundancy & Storage Optimization
Discovered multiple instances of duplicate datasets being pulled across different tables, leading to wasted storage and inconsistent updates.

Consolidated redundant pipelines, deleting ~40% of unused or replicated tables, improving storage efficiency and reducing refresh costs.

Implemented data lineage tracking to prevent future redundancy issues.

3. Unified Data Model for Power Market Datasets (Flows, Prices, Demand, Generation)
Recognized an inefficient wide-column table design where each ISO (NEISO, NYISO, PJM, IESO, etc.) had separate tables for the same dataset (e.g., NeisoDemand, PjmDemand).

Redesigned the schema into a normalized, row-based structure, merging 18+ tables into just 4 master tables (e.g., EastPowerFlows for all ISOs).

Created dynamic views (e.g., vNeisoFlows, vNysioDemand) to maintain backward compatibility while reducing maintenance overhead.

Cut query complexity by 60% and improved aggregation performance for cross-ISO analytics.

4. Metadata-Driven ETL Framework for Scalability
Introduced a flexible, self-service metadata architecture where new data IDs (e.g., power flow nodes, price hubs) could be added without code changes.

Designed metadata control tables (e.g., EastPowerFlowsMetadata) to define sources, IDs, and transformations, allowing quants to onboard new datasets via simple SQL inserts.

Reduced dependency on engineering teams, enabling faster iterations (new data points could be added in minutes instead of days).

Impact & Results
50% reduction in pipeline failures due to robust error handling in Dagster.

70% decrease in storage costs by eliminating redundancy and optimizing table structures.

Faster decision-making for trading teams due to reliable, near-real-time data refreshes.

Future-proofed architecture with metadata-driven design, reducing technical debt.

This initiative not only enhanced data reliability but also empowered quants with self-service capabilities, setting a foundation for scalable analytics
